Project Overview:
This project aims to display real-time system metrics from a Raspberry Pi on a Wio Terminal. The metrics include RAM usage, CPU temperature, network information, and more. Communication between the Pi and the Wio Terminal occurs over the I2C protocol, with the Wio Terminal acting as a slave device that displays the data on its screen.

Setting Up the Raspberry Pi:
Install Dependencies:

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your Raspberry Pi.
Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
sh
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install smbus2 psutil
Python Script:

The Python script gathers system metrics and sends them to the Wio Terminal via I2C.
Save the Python script as send_metrics.py in your home directory or a folder like ~/myapps/.
Run the Python Script on Boot:

To run the script automatically on boot, create a systemd service:

Create a Systemd Service File:

Create a new file using:
sh
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/send_metrics.service
Add the following content to the file:
ini
Copy code
[Unit]
Description=Send System Metrics to Wio Terminal
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=idle
User=pi  # Replace 'pi' with your username if different
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/myapps/send_metrics.py  # Adjust path if needed

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Enable the Service:

Reload the systemd configuration and enable the service:
sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable send_metrics.service
Start the Service:

Start the service immediately:
sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl start send_metrics.service
Check the status to confirm it's running without issues:
sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl status send_metrics.service
Setting Up the Wio Terminal:
Install Arduino IDE:

Install the Arduino IDE on your computer if you haven't already. Make sure to add the necessary boards for Seeed Wio Terminal by including the URL in your board manager preferences.
Upload the Arduino Code:

Open the provided Arduino code in the IDE.
Select the Wio Terminal board from the Tools menu.
Connect the Wio Terminal to your computer and upload the code.
The code will make the Wio Terminal listen as an I2C slave and update the LCD with system metrics received from the Raspberry Pi.
Connecting the Raspberry Pi and Wio Terminal:
Wiring for I2C:
Connect the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to the Wio Terminal’s I2C pins:
SCL (Serial Clock Line): Connect Raspberry Pi GPIO 3 (SCL) to Wio Terminal SCL.
SDA (Serial Data Line): Connect Raspberry Pi GPIO 2 (SDA) to Wio Terminal SDA.
Ground (GND): Ensure both devices share a common ground.
I2C Configuration on Raspberry Pi:
Enable I2C on the Raspberry Pi:
sh
Copy code
sudo raspi-config
Go to Interfacing Options > I2C and enable it.
To verify that the Wio Terminal is connected properly, run:
sh
Copy code
sudo i2cdetect -y 1
You should see the I2C address (typically 0x08 for this project) listed on the bus.
Debugging and Verifying:
Arduino Serial Monitor:

Open the Serial Monitor from the Arduino IDE to observe the data received by the Wio Terminal. This will help you verify that the data is coming in correctly from the Raspberry Pi.
Python Debug Output:

The Python script prints each metric as it sends data. You can run the script manually to see the output and confirm what’s being transmitted:
sh
Copy code
python3 /home/pi/myapps/send_metrics.py
I2C Communication Check:

Use i2cdetect on the Raspberry Pi to ensure that the Wio Terminal is recognized and the correct I2C address is shown.
Final Notes:
Data Display: The Wio Terminal dynamically updates the display based on the metrics received from the Raspberry Pi. Metrics such as RAM, CPU, and storage are continuously updated.
Performance: To reduce flickering and maintain performance, only portions of the display are updated when their corresponding metrics change.
This guide allows others to replicate your setup and understand how to configure both the Raspberry Pi and Wio Terminal for real-time metric display.
